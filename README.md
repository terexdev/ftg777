# Friendly Telegram Userbot
A fast, easy to setup telegram userbot running Python 3 which uses the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/) Library.

Friendly Telegram, also known as FTG, is not your average Telegram userbot: it's faster, can load modules dynamically and is very easy to use!

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- API ID and Hash from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
- Some basic knowledege (although you can usually mindlessly copy&paste from the docs)

### Documentation
We've made docs to help you to set-up the bot.
They can be found [here](https://friendly-telegram.gitlab.io).

### Support
We also have a dedicated Telegram support group. Got any doubts or issues while setting-up? Shoot 'em here! **Please read the docs first** though, to make sure your question isn't already answered!
